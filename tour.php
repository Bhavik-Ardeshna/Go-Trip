        <h2>Niagra Falls</h2>
        <h3>Niagara Falls is a beautiful sight at any time of year. You can always capture good photos here in the summer, but winter offers something truly special. The ice-covered railings and tree limbs, and the giant plume of mist rising off the falls on still days make for some great photos. Many of the attractions in Niagara Falls offer great ways to see the falls and opportunities for beautiful photos.</h3>

        <h2>Golden Pavilion</h2>
        <h3>Kinkaku-ji or the Temple of the Golden Pavilion is the most popular tourist attraction in Japan and Kyoto. The pavilion was originally built as a retirement villa for Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu in the late 14th century. Unfortunately, the pavilion was burnt down in 1950 by a young monk who had become obsessed with it. Five years later, the temple was rebuilt as an exact copy of the original. Emphasis is placed on the building and surrounding gardens being in harmony with one another. </h3>
